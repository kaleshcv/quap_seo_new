How is tax calculated?
The sales tax amount is based on your shipping address and the current tax rates in that jurisdiction. Tax will be displayed during checkout before you pay for your order.

Items with in-store pickup selected will be charged sales tax based on the location of the store.

Note: Some states do not offer refunds on tax applied to core charges
